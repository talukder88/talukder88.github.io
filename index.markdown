[CV](CV.pdf)

I am a third year PhD student, advised by [Dr. Ratnesh Kumar](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~rkumar/), in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the 
[Iowa State University](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/). I am a self-motivated spontaneous researcher and team player. My research interests include 
*deep learning, reinforcement learning, polynomial optimization, coalition games and formal methods*, with *power systems* as the application domain.

In summer 2019, I interned with [GE Global Research Center](https://www.ge.com/research/) in NY, USA. I also have past industrial experience of 8 years
 at [GE Grid Solutions](https://www.gegridsolutions.com/) and [ITC Ltd.](https://www.itcportal.com/) in India, prior starting my PhD program.
