[CV](CV.pdf)

I am a 5th year PhD student, advised by [Dr. Ratnesh Kumar](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~rkumar/), in Electrical and Computer Engineering department at 
[Iowa State University](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/). My research interest includes *deep learning, reinforcement learning, polynomial optimization,
 coalition games, dynamic stability and control, and formal methods*, mostly with *power systems* as the application domain. 

I completed Bachelors in Electrical Engineering
 from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/), India in 2009. Prior to starting my doctoral study, I spent 8 years
in industry at [GE Grid Solutions](https://www.gegridsolutions.com/) and [ITC Ltd.](https://www.itcportal.com/). As part of my doctoral 
study, I did internships in [Tesla, Inc.](https://www.tesla.com/) and [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/) in 
Fall 2021 and Summer 2021, respectively. I also interned in [GE Research](https://www.ge.com/research/) 
in Summer 2019 and Fall 2020.
