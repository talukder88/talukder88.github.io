1. *Stability Guaranteed Deep Reinforcement-learning (current research area)*: Guaranteeing dynamic stability of nonlinear plants controlled by modern Deep Reinforcement-Learning (DRL) agents is an open problem, posing a hurdle in safety/time-critical applications. I am currently analyzing closed-loop stability of such systems computing a Lyapunov function, which is robust to bounded shift of operating equilibrium caused by structural perturbation of the plant. 
2. *Power Systems Anomaly Detection using Deep Neural-networks*: A novel long-short-termmemory (LSTM) based deep-neural-network (DNN) is proposed for early prediction of long-term voltage instability, ensuing a large disturbance in a power-grid. The proposed DNN is capable to utilize both the pre-fault SCADA snapshot and a short-prefix of the post-fault time-series ofPMU measurements for prediction, showing substantial improvement in its noise-robustness over the state-of-the-art.
3. *Sum-of-squares Optimization*: An algorithmic enhancement of the traditional sum-of-squares optimization based region-of-attraction (ROA) estimation for power systems is proposed, showing significant reduction in the overall computation time. The approach is further extended to compute the volume of the estimated ROA as a sub-level set of a Lyapunov function, which provides a metric to quantify the transient stability of a power system in polynomial time computational complexity.
4. *Resilience Indices for Cyberphysical Systems*: A physical-topology guided notion of resilience for power systems is quantified as a six dimensional normalized vector, which is the probabilistic average of such vectors corresponding to the individual credible fault-sequences. A new way of computing transient stability margin and critical clearance time using sum-of-squares optimization is proposed. Also a novel approach to compute relay margin by solving an iterative quadratic-constraint-quadratic-program is introduced.
